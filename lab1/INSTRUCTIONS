1. Read the most recent version of the class syllabus, either the one on the course website
or the one checked into this repository. Note that somewhere in the syllabus is an unusual
statement; make note of this statement.

2. Create a simple C program in a file named "lab1.c" in this directory. This program should simply 
print two lnes of text. The first should say "I, *your name here*, have read the syllabus and 
agree to policies described in it". The second line should be the unusual statement you found while
reading the syllabus above.

3. Create a makefile for your C program (named "Makefile") that, when 'make' is run at
the command line with no arguments, compiles lab1.c into the executable 'lab1'. Also create
a make target entitled 'clean' that removes the lab1 executable and all object files from 
the current directory.

4. Make sure that "lab1.c" and "Makefile" are added to your git repository, and that your changes 
are pushed back to lobogit.

5. On lobogit, go to list of commits for your project, click on the commit you want to use for your 
submission of this assignment, and make note of the full commit ID of the git commit you want
to turn in (it should be a hex string about 40 characters long).

6. On UNM Learn, turn in *only* the commit ID of the version of your project you want graded by the 
due time of the assignment.
